# Digit Recognition with Noisy Features

The program trains a perceptron from scratch to recognize digits 0–9 represented as 7×5 pixel grids. After pressing Train, users can select any digit, optionally add random pixel noise, and press Guess to see the perceptron’s classification displayed in the right grid. Without training, the perceptron cannot recognize digits since its weights are initialized randomly.
